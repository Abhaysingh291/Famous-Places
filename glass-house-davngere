## About Their Foods
The most loved street food among the residents of Davangere, it is similar to the Masala Dosa. Ingredients used to make are Urad Dal, Rice and Methi which are served with Coconut Chutney (cold sauce);it makes you crave for more once you start eating. Benne Dosa in evening will be the best snack ever.
