# Golghar - Nihal

## About Tourist Place 
he Golghar is a massive granary devised by Captain John Garstin of Bengal Engineers and constructed in 1786 in Patna, the capital city of Bihar. 
The depository, having a capacity of 140000 tonnes, was built after the orders of Warren Hastings who was the Governor-General of India at that time. 
It was just part of a customary plan to store grains in case of famines with the idea of building a spate of storehouses, but ultimately only one was made, the Golghar.

It is a dome shaped structure reaching up to a height of 29 metres. The top of the Golghar can be outreached by taking the 145 steps spiral staircase. 
The access to the apex is made spiral in order to make it easier and faster for workers to reach there. Apart from being a repository, this simple yet 
stunning structure presents an amazing panoramic view of the entire city and the nearby Ganges. Interestingly, some claim that there is a little flaw 
in the construction and that the doors of the storehouse opens inwards meaning that it can never be filled to its maximum capacity though it had never 
been filled up to its limit.
