## About Place 

Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 
'temple of the God of the field') is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.[1] 
The temple is located in the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river in Uttarakhand, India. 
Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, 
the full autumn moon). 
During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. 
Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', 
the region's historical name.[1]

The temple, at the height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft),
223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini

river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown

 date.[1]
 It is not sure who built the original Kedarnath temple

 and when. The name "Kedarnath" means "the lord of the field": it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya states that it is so called because "the crop of liberation" grows here

The presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m (12 ft) in circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft) in height. A small pillared hall in front of the temple has images of Parvati and the five Pandava princes. There are four temples around Kedarnath itself, namely- Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar, which form the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites.[1] The first hall inside Kedarnath Temple contains statues of the five Pandava brothers, Krishna, and Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva, and Virabhadra, one of the guards of Shiva. Statues of Draupadi and other deities are also installed in the main hall.[2] An unusual feature of the temple is a man's head carved in the triangular stone lingam. A head is carved into another nearby temple constructed on the site where the marriage of Shiva and Parvati was held. Adi Shankara was believed to have revived this temple, along with Badrinath and other temples of Uttarakhand; he is believed to have attained Mahasamadhi at Kedarnath. Behind the temple is the samādhi mandir of Adi Sankara.
