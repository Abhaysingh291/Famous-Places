The state of West Bengal in India has Kolkata as its capital. The city is situated on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, about 80 km (50 mi) west of Bangladesh's border. It serves as the key port of communication for North-East India and the principal business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern India.
As the historical capital of India, Kolkata is renowned for its intellectual, cultural, and revolutionary past; it was the birthplace of contemporary Indian literary and artistic ideas.
