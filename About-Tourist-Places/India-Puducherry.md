## About Tourist Place 
Pondicherry also known as Puducherry, situated on the east coast of India, 135 km south of Chennai, is a former French colony. 
Even years after the French left it, Pondicherry has managed to retain its French influence with tree-lined avenues and Mediterranean style houses that 
lend it a curious non-Indian touch.

The best way to see Pondicherry and its surrounding areas is by renting out a bicycle or a motorcycle (Rs 40 or Rs 200 upwards per day) from the several 
outlets on Mission Street and MG Road.

With the slow pace of life in Pondicherry, there is not much you can do making it an ideal destination for a relaxing holiday. 
While there are a few tourist spots in the area, the major attraction of the area are the different water sporting facilities. 
Scuba Diving, Scuba Jumping and Surfing courses are available in Pondicherry and this attracts a large number of tourists to the area.

Another major attraction in the area is Auroville, an experimental township where people from all countries, races, castes, creeds and political 
ideologies can live together in peace and progressive harmony. Several tourists visit Auroville in order to meditate and focus on spirituality 
instead of material benefits.
