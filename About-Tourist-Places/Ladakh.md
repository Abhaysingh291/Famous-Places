## About Tourist Place 
Ladakh is a union territory in the Kashmir region of India. Formerly falling in the state of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh was administered a union territory on 
31st October 2019. Extending from the Siachen Glacier to the main Great Himalayas, Ladakh is a land like no other. Dominated by dramatic landscapes, Ladakh 
is known as the world's coldest desert.

Stunning Gompas (Tibetan Buddhist monasteries), fluttering prayer flags, whitewashed stupas, Ladakh is a riot of intricate murals and red-robed monks. 
It is said that only in Ladakh can a man sitting in the sun with his feet in the shade suffer from sunstroke and frostbite at the same time. With a 
culture similar to Tibetan culture, the people of Ladakh are friendly and welcoming to tourists.

## About Their Foods
Momos is arguably the most famous food of Ladakh. Momos are now a very common street food item all over north India and especially Delhi, but there is 
something special about having a plate of fresh warm momos in the freezing cold winters of Ladakh. Momos are small pieces of dough that are wrapped 
around a bit of filling and then steamed in a special pot which is called the Mokto in Ladakh. Both meat fillings as well as vegetable fillings are 
used for the momos. These are usually served with some kind of dipping sauce.
