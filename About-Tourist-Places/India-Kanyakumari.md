# Kanyakumari - Prince

## About Tourist Place 
Bordered by the three seas - Arabian, Indian and the Bay of Bengal, Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula. A small coastal town in the 
state of Tamil Nadu, Kanyakumari was earlier known as Cape Comorin. Kanyakumari offers the marvellous confluence of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian 
Sea and the Indian ocean meeting together at a point. But, this is not a miracle, the miracle lies in the beauty that the water of three seas does 
not mix, you can clearly distinguish between the turquoise blue, deep blue and sea green waters of the three seas. To enjoy the best view of sunset 
and sunrise, you can visit the Triveni Sangam point and the famous View tower.

The town has a mountainous terrain with elevated patches of hills, coconut trees and lined with paddy fields. Kanyakumari is also the only place in India 
where you can observe the sunrise and sunset at the same beach.
