According to archaeological findings, Lothal was established by the people of the Indus Valley Civilization, initially by the sea-faring merchants and later by the smiths, masons and potters, among others. Its worth mentioning that Lothal soon grew to become an industrial center and an extremely important port of the empire. Explore the ruins and visit the museum during your visit to Lothal.
