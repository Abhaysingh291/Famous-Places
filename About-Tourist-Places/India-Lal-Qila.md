## About Tourist Place 
The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan 
commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. The Red Fort, which is also known as the Lal Qila, 
was constructed by one of the most famous Mughal emperors, Shah Jahan. Built on the banks of river Yamuna, the fortress-palace was designed by architect 
Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. It took 8 years and 10 months to build the magnificent fort. 

The fort served as the royal residence of the Mughal emperors from 1648 to 1857. It took over the honor of royal residence from the famous Agra Fort when Shah 
Jahan decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. The Red Fort derives its name from the red-sandstone walls, which make the fort almost impregnable. 
The fort, which is located at Old Delhi, is one of the massive and prominent structures of India and is a fine example of Mughal architecture. It is often 
considered as the pinnacle of Mughal creativity. In modern times, the fort is of importance to the people of India as the Indian Prime Minister delivers 
his Independence Day speech from the fort, every year on August 15. In 2007, it was declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site.
