 South Korea - Seoul 

 About Tourist Place 
From modern skyscrapers and neon lights to Buddhist temples, palaces and pagodas, Seoul is a fascinating mix of old and new. Take it all in from the N Seoul Tower,
built atop a peak in Namsan Park. The teahouses and shops of Insadong give you a taste of Korean flavour, which you can further experience with a visit to the grounds
and museums of Gyeongbokgung. UNESCO World Heritage Site Changdeokgung Palace is a fine example of authentic ancient architecture.

About Their Foods
Gukbap hot soup with rice, is a Korean dish made by putting cooked rice into hot soup or boiling rice in soup. It is commonly served in a ttukbaegi. 
Whereas soup and rice have been traditionally served separately at tables in Korea, Gukbap means food putting rice into a soup. But these days, soup
and rice are sometimes served separately in Korean restarurants for several reasons.
